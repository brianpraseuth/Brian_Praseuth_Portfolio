# Brian Praseuth - Portfolio

Created a mobile responsive website consisting of three linked html files. An about me page, a portfolio with filler information, and a basic contact page. 

All of the pages have a working navbar with working links to each page.

The pages were created using Bootstrap gridding and are all responsive. Each page correctly sizes when the windows are resized in to xs, sm, md, and so on. 

All pages have a sticky footer that resized with the windows.
